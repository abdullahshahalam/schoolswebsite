            <p style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; padding-top:20px;"> A school is an educational
                institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students
                under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal education, which is sometimes
                compulsory.[2] In these systems, students progress through a series of schools. The names for these
                schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional terms section below) but generally include primary
                school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. An
                institution where higher education is taught, is commonly called a university college or university In
                addition to these core schools, students in a given country may also attend schools before and after
                primary (elementary in the U.S.) and secondary (middle school in the U.S.) education. Kindergarten or

            (typically ages 3–5). University,vocational school, college or seminary may be available after secondary
            school. A school may be dedicated to one particular field, such as a school of economics or dance.
            Alternative schools may provide nontraditional curriculum and methods.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify; font-style:italic; padding-top:30px;">Non-government schools, also known as
            private schools,[3] may be required when the government does not supply adequate or specific educational
            needs. Other private schools can also be religious, such as Christian schools, gurukula (Hindu schools),
            madrasa (Arabic schools), hawzas (Shi'i Muslim schools), yeshivas (Jewish schools), and others; or schools
            that have a higher standard of education or seek to foster other personal achievements. Schools for adults
            include institutions of corporate training, military education and training and business schools
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; padding-top:30px;">Critics of school often accuse the school
            system of failing to adequately prepare students for their future lives,[4] of encouraging certain
            temperaments while inhibiting others,[5] of prescribing students exactly what to do, how, when, where and
            with whom, which would suppress creativity,[6] and of using extrinsic measures such as grades and homework,
            which would inhibit children's natural curiosity and desire to learn.[7]

        <p style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic;padding:30px 0px;">In homeschooling and distance education,
            teaching and learning take place independent from the institution of school or in a virtual school outside a
            traditional school building, respectively. Schools are organized in several different organizational models,
            including departmental, small learning communities, academies, integrated, and schools-within-a-school.

        <h2>History and development</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic;padding-top:30px;">



            Plato's academy, mosaic from Pompeii
            The concept of grouping students together in a centralized location for learning has existed since Classical
            antiquity. Formal schools have existed at least since ancient Greece (see Academy), ancient Rome (see
            Education in Ancient Rome) ancient India (see Gurukul), and ancient China (see History of education in
            China). The Byzantine Empire had an established schooling system beginning at the primary level. According
            to Traditions and Encounters, the founding of the primary education system began in 425 AD and "... military
            personnel usually had at least a primary education ...". The sometimes efficient and often large government
            of the Empire meant that educated citizens were a must. Although Byzantium lost much of the grandeur of
            Roman culture and extravagance in the process of surviving, the Empire emphasized efficiency in its war
            manuals. The Byzantine education system continued until the empire's collapse in 1453 AD.[11]


        <p style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic;padding-top:30px;">
            In Western Europe, a considerable number of cathedral schools were founded during the Early Middle Ages in
            order to teach future clergy and administrators, with the oldest still existing, and continuously operated,
            cathedral schools being The King's School, Canterbury (established 597 CE), King's School, Rochester
            (established 604 CE), St Peter's School, York (established 627 CE) and Thetford Grammar School (established
            631 CE). Beginning in the 5th century CE, monastic schools were also established throughout Western Europe,
            teaching religious and secular subjects.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic;padding-top:30px;">
            Islam was another culture that developed a school system in the modern sense of the word. Emphasis was put
            on knowledge, which required a systematic way of teaching and spreading knowledge and purpose-built
            structures. At first, mosques combined religious performance and learning activities. However, by the 9th
            century, the madrassa was introduced, a school that was built independently from the mosque, such as
            al-Qarawiyyin, founded in 859 CE. They were also the first to make the Madrassa system a public domain under
            Caliph's control.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic;padding-top:30px;">
            Under the Ottomans, the towns of Bursa and Edirne became the main centers of learning. The Ottoman system of
            Külliye, a building complex containing a mosque, a hospital, madrassa, and public kitchen and dining areas,
            revolutionized the education system, making learning accessible to a broader public through its free meals,
            health care, and sometimes free accommodation.</p>






        <p style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic;padding-top:30px;">
            In Europe, universities emerged during the 12th century; here, scholasticism was an important tool, and the
            academicians were called schoolmen. During the Middle Ages and much of the Early Modern period, the main
            purpose of schools (as opposed to universities) was to teach the Latin language. This led to the term
            grammar school, which in the United States informally refers to a primary school, but in the United Kingdom
            means a school that selects entrants based on ability or aptitude. The school curriculum has gradually
            broadened to include literacy in the vernacular language and technical, artistic, scientific, and practical
            subjects.


        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic;padding-top:30px;">
            Obligatory school attendance became common in parts of Europe during the 18th century. In Denmark-Norway,
            this was introduced as early as in 1739–1741, the primary end being to increase the literacy of the almue,
            i.e., the "regular people".[12] Many of the earlier public schools in the United States and elsewhere were
            one-room schools where a single teacher taught seven grades of boys and girls in the same classroom.
            Beginning in the 1920s, one-room schools were consolidated into multiple classroom facilities with
            transportation increasingly provided by kid hacks and school buses.</p>

            In the United Kingdom, the term school refers primarily to pre-university institutions, and these can, for
            the most part, be divided into pre-schools or nursery schools, primary schools (sometimes further divided
            into infant school and junior school), and secondary schools. Various types of secondary schools in England
            and Wales include grammar schools, comprehensives, secondary moderns, and city academies. While they may
            have different names in Scotland, there is only one type of secondary school. However, they may be funded
            either by the state or independently funded. Scotland's school performance is monitored by Her Majesty's
            Inspectorate of Education. Ofsted reports on performance in England and Estyn reports on performance in
            Wales.</p>
